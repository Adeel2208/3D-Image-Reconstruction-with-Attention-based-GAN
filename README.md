# 3D-Image-Reconstruction-with-Attention-based-GAN
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for 3D image reconstruction, utilizing a U-Net-based generator with attention mechanisms and a PatchGAN discriminator. It processes RGB images and masks, incorporating data augmentation, perceptual loss (via VGG16), and gradient penalty for stable training.
